# NYT-React

Welcome to the New York Times Article Search web application.

Users are able to search for and display articles of interest. All that is needed is a topic and a range of years in which they wish to find articles. 

This full-stack web app is a React-based search tool that uses React components, helper functions, and the React mounting lifecycle to query a database and display articles. Users can also save and delete articles at their choosing.

Tech Stack used for this application includes Mongo DB (for the database), Express JS, Node JS, and React JS.
